Disease Prognosis and Analysis Application
This application is a Streamlit-based tool for analyzing and predicting disease prognosis using a cardiovascular dataset. It provides various data visualizations, statistical summaries, and predictive analytics. The application also supports media display functionality, allowing users to upload and view images, videos, and audio files.
Features
•	Data Filtering: Filter the dataset based on height and weight.
•	Data Visualization: Generate scatter plots, bar graphs, and histograms.
•	Statistical Summary: View statistical summaries and correlation heatmaps of the data.
•	Prediction Model: Predict patient weight based on height using a simple linear regression model.
•	Media Display: Upload and display images, videos, and audio files within the application.
•	Download Filtered Data: Download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.
